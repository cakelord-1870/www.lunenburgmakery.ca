All of the production stages of this kit - design, assembly, and packaging - have been lovingly completed by a small staff here in our little shop in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>We designed this cactus kit to be a charming addition to an existing plant display, a unique house-warming or host gift, or perhaps a present for someone with the least of green thumbs!</p>
<p>The perfect felt houseplant requires no water, thrives under any lighting conditions, and will survive repeated repotting - even from your cat. You don't even have to worry about poking your fingers (unless you use it as a pin cushion).</p>
<p><span>This boxed kit comes with everything you need to complete a wool felt cactus. </span><span></span>We've included the following in this kit:</p>
<p><span><span>• Step-by-step illustrated instructions</span><br><span>• Paper pattern pieces</span><br><span>• 100% wool felt</span><br><span>• Natural sheep's wool stuffing</span><br><span>• Needle and embroidery thread</span></span></p>
<p><span>Finished cactus is approx. 5" high and fits on top of a 3" wide pot <em>(clay pot not included)</em>. Be sure to check out the rest of our individual cactus kits and the cactus garden!</span></p>
<p>Happy sewing!</p></td>
